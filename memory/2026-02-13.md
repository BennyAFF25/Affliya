# 2026-02-13

- User: Ben Brown confirmed.
- Reinforced Nettmark patch protocol: always draft PLAN, require explicit `APPROVE <ticket>` before changes, use ops/patches queue.
- Completed TICKET-001 plan + implementation (shared DashboardCard component, normalized affiliate dashboard cards). Patch stored in ops/patches/queue.
- User wants UI consistency improvements first; backend integrity roadmap prepared for future work.
- Reminder: cannot access Vercel runtime logs directly; need user-provided output or automation bridge.
