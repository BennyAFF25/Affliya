NETTMARK — FOUNDATIONAL VISION

Core Identity

Nettmark is a performance-based advertising infrastructure platform that connects:
	•	Businesses (who own ad accounts and offers)
	•	Affiliates (who fund traffic and drive sales)

All tracking, ad execution, attribution, billing, wallet flows, and payouts occur under one system.

Nettmark is not an affiliate directory.
It is an execution layer for performance marketing.
